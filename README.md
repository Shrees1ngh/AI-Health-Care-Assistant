Prerequisites
You need a modern web browser and a code editor (like VS Code).

Installation
Clone the repo
git clone [https://github.com/Shrees1ngh/AI-Health-Care-Assistant.git](https://github.com/Shrees1ngh/AI-Health-Care-Assistant.git)
Get a Google Gemini API Key
Go to Google AI Studio.
Click "Create API key" and copy the generated key.
Add the API Key to the project
Open the index.html file.
Find the <script> tag at the bottom of the file.
Locate the following line:
const apiKey = ""; // Enter you api key
Paste your API key inside the quotation marks:
const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
Run the application with a local server
You cannot run this project by opening the HTML file directly in the browser due to CORS policy restrictions on API requests.
If you are using VS Code, the easiest way is to install the Live Server extension.
After installation, right-click the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server". This will open the project in your browser on a local server.
Usage
Once the application is running in your browser:

Use the Health Chat tab for general questions.
Switch to the Analyze Medical Report tab to paste and simplify report text.
Navigate to the Lifestyle Advisor tab to get a symptom action plan or generate a meal plan.
